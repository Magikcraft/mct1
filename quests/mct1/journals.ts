My powers are returning. Soon I will be strong enough to escape the fortress.

If you are reading this, follow me. There is food and medicine`,

        `under the bed.

Try to keep your BGL level in healthy, keep the bar green.

If you make it to the portal, join us in Castellum.

Together we will be strong enough to stop the Wither once and for all... Good luck!`,

Thankfully, none of the Wither’s monsters seem to...`,

        `wander out this far.

I hope the refilling runes are working on the bottle I left in the cell.  So long as they are, your insulin supply will never run out.  Food can be found and potions made, but medicine is harder to come by.`,

It took a lot of swimming and jumping just to get through. Food is going to become a problem...`,

There was a hole in the wall along the way. It took a while to reach but I managed to climb out and...`,

Hopefully the next area will be drier.`,

But it will be difficult. If the Magma Cubes were just the guard dogs, the monsters within will be too much for any normal villager to escape.\n\n
But maybe you are like me? If so, there is something that can help.\n\n
People like us – Glykosans – are special. The need for insulin and sugar is the price we pay, but those who manage the condition well can gain great power over time. You probably felt a taste of this when you were first chosen. It fades as blood sugar spikes and falls, but with control these powers can be regained.\n\n
Myself, and others, belong to a small group of Alchemists. We wanted to see if we could develop potions that helped young Glykosans gain powers faster.\n\n
This is why the Wither is hunting. He wants the secrets of this alchemy, to create potions that give his own mobs power. He will raid every village in the world until the alchemists are captured and under his control. If he discovers our secrets his armies will be unstoppable.\n\n
The Wither does not know, but I was carrying a bottle of a new, experimental, catalyst potion when he captured me. His guards searched me but I was able to keep it from them.\n\n
I leave it for you now.\n\n
With it you can gain three of our powers – swiftness, leaping and the ability to call down thunder. These powers will be with you permanently, but be warned – only those with good control will be able to access their true effects.\n\n
Still, these powers alone will not be enough. Once you are free, join us in Castellum. With enough Glykosans together we can begin a plan to end the Demon threat for good.\n\n
See you soon.`
